# Restaurant Reservations

This project is a continuation of the 'React with Redux Toolkit Crash Course' course
It is a very good course that teaches the new Redux Toolkit taught by Laith Harb.
In this repository I added CSS styling using Tailwind and styled-components, did unit test and e2e tests.
Contributions are always welcome!
